# Weston Dombroski Portfolio Project
Weston Dombroski's Portfolio Project: This site utilizes html, css, and (though I'm still very much working on it) javascript and jquery as well.

the js is giving me a lot of trouble currently, but all of the page content is in html document:
  - the nav menu will eventually be a dropdown menu
  - each menu button is to link to the various pages in the index.html document

Ultimately, this site will provide an expansive resource of the web development projects that I believe best show my capabilities as a web developer.
